Simple Example

The goal of this example is to introduce you to running EMOD-Malaria via emodpy-malaria.
The example configures a simulation that:
- runs for 80 simulation days
- has 100 people
- distributes ivermectin to all of the people on day three.

The example also demonstrates other features that are useful when modeling:

- SWEEP - It sweeps the parameter Run_Number which is the random number seed.  This will result
in a colleciton of simulations that are only different by their initial random number seed.

- DOWNLOAD - Once the simulations are done, it will "download" the report files to a directory called
"results" for easier access.

- PLOT - Once the files are downloaded, the results of the simulations will be plotted and
an image will be produced.
