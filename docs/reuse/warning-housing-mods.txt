.. warning::

    |EMOD_s| simulations models nodes and individuals within nodes; they do not
    model houses. Therefore, housing modifications are received by individuals, not houses.

    Use of this class and other housing modification classes requires caution because they can have 
    unintended effects. For example, individuals in the same household may receive different housing
    modification interventions.  An individual receiving a housing modification intervention who
    then migrates to another node will continue to receive that intervention. We recommend that you 
    configure your simulation to take these logical inconsistencies into account.
