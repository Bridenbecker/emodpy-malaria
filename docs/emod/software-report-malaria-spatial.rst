SpatialReportMalariaFiltered
============================

The filtered malaria spatial report (SpatialReportMalariaFiltered.bin) provides spatial information
on malaria simulations, similar to the :doc:`software-report-spatial`, but allows for filtering the
data and collection over different intervals.  The output of this file differs from the spatial
output report by adding **Start_Day** and a **Reporting_Interval**.



Configuration
=============

To generate the report, configure the following parameters in the custom_report.json file:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Min, Max, Default, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20

    **Filename_Suffix**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "Augments the filename of the report. If multiple reports are being generated, this allows you to distinguish among the multiple reports."
    **Start_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","0","The day of the simulation to start collecting data."
    **End_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","3.40282e+38","The day of the simulation to stop collecting data."
    **Node_IDs_Of_Interest**,"array of integers","0","2.14748e+09","[]","Data will be collected for the nodes in this list.  Empty list implies all nodes."
    **Min_Age_Years**,"float","0","9.3228e+35","0","Minimum age in years of people to collect data on."
    **Max_Age_Years**,"float","0","9.3228e+35","9.3228e+35","Maximum age in years of people to collect data on."
    **Must_Have_IP_Key_Value**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "A Key:Value pair that the individual must have in order to be included. Empty string means to not include IPs in the selection criteria."
    **Must_Have_Intervention**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "The name of the intervention that the person must have in order to be included. Empty string means to not include interventions in the selection criteria."
    **Reporting_Interval**, float, 0, 3.40E+38, 1, The number of days to collect data and average over.
    **Spatial_Output_Channels**, list of strings, NA, NA, (empty string), "An array of channel names for spatial output by node and time step. The data from each channel will be written to a separate binary file. See the table below for all possible channels."


For more information on spatial reports, see :doc:`software-report-spatial`.

.. we do not have examples of output for spatial reports. This is the same as the builtin report (spatial output report)
.. but for malaria (if you choose spatial output report for MALARIA_SIM, you get SpatialReportMalaria). So we should get examples of those...

Report structure and data channel descriptions
==============================================

The file contains the following data channels:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Data channel, Description
    :widths: 15, 25

    Adult_Vectors, "The total number of adult female vectors in the node at each time step. Includes vectors from all species and all infectious sates (not infected, infected, and infectious)." 
    Air_Temperature, The air temperature of that day for that node in Celcius. 
    Births,The live births cumulative up to that day for that node.
    Blood_Smear_Gametocyte_Prevalence, "The fraction of the population that is detectable with the BLOOD_SMEAR_GAMETOCYTES version of **MalariaDiagnostic**. The detectability of the diagnostic is controlled by the parameters **Report_Gametocyte_Smear_Sensitivity** and **Report_Detection_Threshold_Blood_Smear_Gametocytes**." 
    Blood_Smear_Parasite_Prevalence, "The fraction of the population that is detectable with the BLOOD_SMEAR_PARASITES version of **MalariaDiagnostic**. The detectability of the diagnostic is controlled by the parameters **Report_Parasite_Smear_Sensitivity** and **Report_Detection_Threshold_Blood_Smear_Parasites**."
    Campaign_Cost, "The cumulative cost of the interventions that have been distributed to that node. This is based on the **Cost_To_Consumer** parameter in the interventions used." 
    Daily_Bites_Per_Human, The average number of mosquito bites received per individual on that day. 
    Daily_EIR, "The number of infectious bites per person in the node made that day/reporting period as determined by the vector model. It includes the infectious bites of all species for both indoor and outdoor bites." 
    Disease_Deaths, "The number of people that died in the node that day. The population for the node at the beginning of the next time step will be the population at this time step minus the number of deaths plus new births." 
    Fever_Prevalence, "This fraction is the number of people whose fever is above the **Report_Detection_Threshold_Fever** threshold divided by the number of people in the node." 
    Human_Infectious_Reservoir,"The sum of the infectiousness of each person in the node; a person's infectiousness is the probability of infecting a mosquito during a successful blood meal." 
    Infected, The fraction of the population currently infected.
    Infectious Vectors, The fraction of vectors in the simulation that are currently infected and infectious.
    Land_Temperature, "The temperature of the land/ground that day in that node in degrees Celsius." 
    Mean_Parasitemia, The geometric mean number of parasites per microliter of blood.
    New_Clinical_Cases, The number of new clinical cases for a given day.
    New_Infections, The number of people who received a new infection in that node on that time step.
    New_Reported_Infections, "The number of people reported to have received a new infection in that node on that time step. This number should be about 50% of the value in **New_Infections**."
    New_Severe_Cases, "The number of new severe cases of malaria on that day in the node.  An individual is considered to be a severe case if the combined probability of anemia, parasite density, and fever is greater than a uniform random number.  This combined probability is the combination of sigmoid using the following parameters: **Anemia_Severe_Threshold** and **Anemia_Severe_Inverse_Width**, **Parasite_Severe_Threshold** and **Parasite_Severe_Inverse_Width**, and **Fever_Severe_Threshold** and **Fever_Severe_Inverse_Width**." 
    PCR_Gametocyte_Prevalence, "The fraction of the population that is detectable with the PCR_GAMETOCYTES version of **MalariaDiagnostic**. The detectability of the diagnostic is controlled by the parameter **Report_Detection_Threshold_PCR_Gametocytes**."
    PCR_Parasite_Prevalence, "The fraction of the population that is detectable with the PCR_PARASITES version of **MalariaDiagnostic**. The detectability of the diagnostic is controlled by the parameter **Report_Detection_Threshold_PCR_Parasites**."  
    PfHRP2_Prevalence, "The fraction of the population that is detectable with the PF_HRP2 version of **MalariaDiagnostic**. The detectability of the diagnostic is controlled by the parameter **Report_Detection_Threshold_PCR_PfHRP2**." 
    Population, The total number of individuals in the node on that day.
    Prevalence, The fraction of the population currently infected in that node on that day. 
    Rainfall, The number millimeters of rainfall in that node on that day. 
    Relative_Humidity, The amount of water vapor present in air expressed as a percentage of the amount needed for saturation at the same temperature for the node on that day.
    True_Prevalence, "The fraction of the population that is detectable with the TRUE_PARASITE_DENSITY version of **MalariaDiagnostic**. The detectability of the diagnostic is controlled by the parameter **Report_Detection_Threshold_True_Parasite_Density**."
