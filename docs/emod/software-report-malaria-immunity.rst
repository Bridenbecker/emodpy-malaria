MalariaImmunityReport
=====================

The malaria immunity report (MalariaImmunityReport.json) is a JSON-formatted file that provides
statistics for several antibody types for specified age bins over a specified reporting duration.
Specifically, the report tracks the average and standard deviation in the fraction of observed
antibodies for :term:`merozoite surface protein (MSP)`, :term:`Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1)`, and non-specific (and less immunogenic) minor surface epitopes. The
total amount possible is determined by the parameters **Falciparum_MSP_Variants**,
**Falciparum_PfEMP1_Variants**, and **Falciparum_Nonspecific_Types**. The greater the fraction, the
more antibodies the individual has against possible new infections. The smaller the fraction, the
more naive the individualâ€™s immune system is to malaria.





Configuration
=============

To generate this report, the following parameters must be configured in the custom_reports.json file:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter name, Data type, Min, Max, Default, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20

    **Filename_Suffix**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "Augments the filename of the report. If multiple reports are being generated, this allows you to distinguish among the multiple reports."
    **Start_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","0","The day of the simulation to start collecting data."
    **End_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","3.40282e+38","The day of the simulation to stop collecting data."
    **Node_IDs_Of_Interest**,"array of integers","0","2.14748e+09","[]","Data will be collected for the nodes in this list.  Empty list implies all nodes."
    **Reporting_Interval**, integer, 1, 1000000, 1000000, "Defines the cadence of the report by specifying how many time steps to collect data before writing to the file. This will limit system memory usage and is advised when large output files are expected."
    **Max_Number_Reports**, integer, 0, 1000000, 1, The maximum number of report output files that will be produced for a given campaign.
    **Pretty_Format**, boolean, 0, 1, 0, "True (1) sets pretty JSON formatting. The default, false (0), saves space."
    **Age_Bins**, array of integers, 0, 125, [ ], "The age bins (in years, in ascending order) to aggregate within and report. An empty array does not stratify by age."

The following is an example of MalariaImmunityReport.json. Notice there are five age bins and two reporting intervals.
