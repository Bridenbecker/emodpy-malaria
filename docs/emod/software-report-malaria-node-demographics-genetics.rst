ReportNodeDemographicsMalariaGenetics
=====================================

The malaria genetics node demographics report (ReportNodeDemographcsMalariaGenetics.csv)  extends
the data collected in the malaria node demographics report by adding data about the number of
infections with specific gentic barcodes. The malaria node demographics genetics report does not
include columns for **Genome_Markers** because this report assumes that the simulation setup
parameter **Malaria_Model** is set to MALARIA_MECHANISTIC_MODEL_WITH_PARASITE_GENETICS.

.. note::

    If you need detailed data on the infections with different barcodes, use the
    :doc:`software-report-malaria-sql`. That report contains data on all barcodes, without specifying
    what they are.





Configuration
=============

To generate this report, the following parameters must be configured in the custom_reports.json file:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Min, Max, Default, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20

    **Age_Bins**, array of floats, -3.04E+38, 3.04E+38, [ ], "The age bins (in years, in ascending order) to aggregate within and report. An empty array does not stratify by age."
    **Barcodes**, array of strings, NA, NA, [ ], "A list of barcode strings. The report contains the number of human infections with each barcode.  Use '*' for a wild card at a loci to include all values at that loci.  For example, 'A*T' includes AAT, ACT, AGT, and ATT. The report contains an OtherBarcodes column for barcodes that are not defined. Note: There is no validation that the barcode strings are valid barcodes for the scenario."
    **Drug_Resistant_Statistic_Type**, enum, NA, NA, NUM_PEOPLE_WITH_RESISTANT_INFECTION, "Indicates the statistic in the DrugResistant columns. Possible values are: NUM_PEOPLE_WITH_RESISTANT_INFECTION: A person is counted if they have one infection with that drug resistant marker; NUM_INFECTIONS: the total number of infections with that marker."
    **Drug_Resistant_Strings**, array of strings, NA, NA, [ ], "A list of strings representing the set of drug resistant markers. A column will be created with the number of human infections with that barcode. One can use a '*' for a wild card. An 'OtherBarcodes' column will be created for barcodes not defined."
    **IP_Key_To_Collect**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "The name of the **IndividualProperties** (IP) key by which to stratify the report. An empty string means the report is not stratified by IP."
    **Stratify_By_Gender**, bool, NA, NA, 1, "Set to true (1) to stratify by gender. Set to false (0) to not stratify by gender."
    **Stratify_By_Has_Clinical_Symptoms**, bool, NA, NA, 1, "If set to 1, the data will have an extra stratification for people who have clinical symptoms and those that do not.  Default is 0 or no extra stratification."

Output file data
================

The report will contain the following output data, divided between stratification columns and data
columns.


Stratification columns
----------------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 20

    Time, float, The day of the simulation that the data was collected.
    NodeID, integer, The External ID of the node for the data in the row in the report.
    Gender, enum, "Possible values are M or F; the gender of the individuals in the row in the report.  This column only appears if **Stratify_By_Gender** = 1."
    AgeYears, float, "The max age in years of the bin for the individuals in the row in the report.  If **Age_Bins** is empty, this column does not appear."
    IndividualProp, string, "The value of the IP for the individuals in the row in the report.  If **IP_Key_To_Collect** is an empty string, then this column does not appear."
    HasClinicalSymptoms, enum, "T implies that the people in the row are having clinical symptoms.  F implies they do not.  This column only appears if **Stratify_By_Has_Clinical_Symptoms** = 1."

Data columns
------------

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description
    :widths: 15, 5, 40

    NumIndividuals, integer, The number of individuals who meet the stratification values.
    NumInfected, integer, The number of infected individuals who meet the stratification values.
    NodeProp = <Node Property Keys>, string, "For each possible Node Property, there is one column where the data in the column is the value of that particular property. If there are no Node Properties, then there are no columns."
    AvgInfectiousness, float, "The average infectiousness to mosquitos for the individuals of this row.  Infectiousness is based on the number of mature gametocytes that the person has."
    AvgParasiteDensity, float, The average true parasite density for the individuals of this row.
    AvgGametocyteDensity, float, The average true gametocyte density for the individuals of this row.
    AvgVariantFractionPfEMP1Major, float, "For each individual, a count is made of the number of PfEMP1 Major antibodies the individual has and is divided by the total number of possible variants (Falciparum_PfEMP1_Variants). This is the average of this value for all the individuals represented in this row."
    AvgNumInfections, float, The average number of infections for the people of this row.
    AvgInfectionClearedDuration, float, The average duration to clear infections for the people of this row.
    NumInfectionsCleared, integer, The number of cleared infections for the people of this row.
    NumHasFever, integer, The number of people in the row that have a fever according to the diagnostic using the **Report_Detection_Threshold_Fever** parameter.
    NumHasClinicalSymptoms, integer, "If **Stratify_By_Has_Clinical_Symptoms** = 0, then this column is present with the number of people in the row that are considered to have 'clinical' symptoms."
    [barcodes], integer, "The number of human infections with the barcode that is the column header. If you used a wild card at a loci, it includes all the barcodes that match the other loci exactly but ignores differences at this loci. For example, A*T includes AAT, ACT, AGT, and ATT. There will be one column for each barcode."
    OtherBarcodes, integer, The number of human infections whose barcode is not counted by the other columns.
