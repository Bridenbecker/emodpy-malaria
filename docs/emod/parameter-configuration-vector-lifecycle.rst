Vector life cycle
=================

The following parameters determine the characteristics of the vector life cycle. Set the vector species
to include in the simulation and the feeding, egg-laying, migration, and larval development habits
of each using these parameters. The parameters for larval development related to habitat and
climate are described in :doc:`parameter-configuration-larval`.
