ReportDrugStatus
================


The drug status report (ReportDrugStatus.csv) provides status information on the drugs that an
individual has taken or is waiting to take. Because the report provides information for each drug,
for each individual, and for each time step, you may want to use the **Start_Day** and **End_Day**
parameters to limit the size of the output file. You cannot filter based on the demographics parameter
**IndividualProperties**.



Configuration
=============

To generate this report, configure the following parameters in the custom_report.json file:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter name, Data type, Min, Max, Default, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20

    **End_Day**, float, 0, 3.40E+38, 3.40E+38, "The day to stop collecting data for the report."
    **Start_Day**, float, 0, 3.40E+38, 0, The day to start collecting data for the report.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "Reports": [
            {
                "Start_Day": 300,
                "End_Day": 900,
                "class": "ReportDrugStatus"
            }
        ],
        "Use_Defaults": 1
    }

    Time, integer, The day of the simulation on which the data was collected for the data in the row.
    NodeID, string, The external ID of the node.



The report contains the following data columns:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Description
