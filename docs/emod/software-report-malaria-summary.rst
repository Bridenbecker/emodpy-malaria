MalariaSummaryReport
====================

The malaria summary report (MalariaSummaryReport.json) is a JSON-formatted report that provides a
population-level summary of malaria data grouped into different bins such as age, parasitemia, and
infectiousness.



Configuration
=============

To generate this report, the following parameters must be configured in the custom_reports.json file:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Parameter, Data type, Min, Max, Default, Description
    :widths: 8, 5, 5, 5, 5, 20

    **Filename_Suffix**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "Augments the filename of the report. If multiple reports are being generated, this allows you to distinguish among the multiple reports."
    **Start_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","0","The day of the simulation to start collecting data."
    **End_Day**,"float","0","3.40282e+38","3.40282e+38","The day of the simulation to stop collecting data."
    **Node_IDs_Of_Interest**,"array of integers","0","2.14748e+09","[]","Data will be collected for the nodes in this list.  Empty list implies all nodes."
    **Must_Have_IP_Key_Value**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "A Key:Value pair that the individual must have in order to be included. Empty string means to not include IPs in the selection criteria."
    **Must_Have_Intervention**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "The name of the intervention that the person must have in order to be included. Empty string means to not include interventions in the selection criteria."
    **Reporting_Interval**, integer, 1, 1000000, 1000000, "Defines the cadence of the report by specifying how many time steps to collect data before writing to the file. This will limit system memory usage and is advised when large output files are expected."
    **Max_Number_Reports**, integer, 0, 1000000, 1, The maximum number of report output files that will be produced for a given campaign per simulation.
    **Pretty_Format**, boolean, 0, 1, 0, "True (1) sets pretty JSON formatting. The default, false (0), saves space."
    **Age_Bins**, array of floats, 0, 125, "[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,1000]", "The age bins to aggregate within and report. Data must be in ascending order."
    **Parasitemia_Bins**, float, -3.40E+38, 3.40E+38, "[50,500,5000,50000,FLT_MAX]", "Parasitemia Bins to aggregate within and report.  A value greater than or equal to zero in the first bin indicates that the uninfected people should be added to this bin.  The values must be in ascending order."
    **Infectiousness_Bins**, float, -3.40E+38, 3.40E+38, "[20,40,60,80,100]", Infectiousness bins to aggregate within and report.
    **Individual_Property_Filter**, string, NA, NA, (empty string), "The individual 'property:value' to filter on. The default of an empty string means the report is not filtered. For example: 'Risk:High'."

The amount that an individualâ€™s fever is above normal must be greater than both of these values to be considered clinical.  This can also be influenced by the **Min_Days_Between_Clinical_Incidents** parameter."
    Annual Severe Incidence by Age Bin, "The number of new severe symptoms per person per year.  An individual is considered to be a severe case if the combined probability of anemia, parasite density, and fever is greater than a uniform random number.  This combined probability is the combination of sigmoid using the following parameters: **Anemia_Severe_Threshold** and **Anemia_Severe_Inverse_Width**, **Parasite_Severe_Threshold** and **Parasite_Severe_Inverse_Width**, **Fever_Severe_Threshold** and **Fever_Severe_Inverse_Width**."
