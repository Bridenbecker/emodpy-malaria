"Malaria_Strain_Model","enum","NA","NA","FALCIPARUM_NONRANDOM_STRAIN","The generator that is used to construct the antigenic repertoire of a malaria infection. To create parasite diversity, various antigenic strains are created by conducting draws for :term:`merozoite surface protein (MSP)` variants, :term:`Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1)` variants, and minor surface epitopes, out of available populations. Each possible value for this parameter utilizes different settings for the available population draws.
Possible values are: 

FALCIPARUM_NONRANDOM_STRAIN
    The strain created uses the exact same MSP variant, non-specific PfEMP1 variant, and ordered repertoire of PfEMP1 major epitopes. Minor surface protein epitopes are randomly drawn from a set of 5.
FALCIPARUM_RANDOM50_STRAIN
    Strain creation extends the logic used for FALCIPARUM_NONRANDOM_STRAIN, but increases variation by randomly drawing PfEMP1 variants from a population of 50, and allowing the variants to have a random switching order. Random draws are done with replacement. 
FALCIPARUM_RANDOM_STRAIN
    The MSP variant is drawn from the population set by the parameter **Falciparum_MSP_Variants**, a repertoire of 50 PfEMP1 variants is drawn from the population set by the parameter **Falciparum_PfEMP1_Variants**, and the set of five minor surface protein epitope variants is drawn from the population set by the parameter **Falciparum_Nonspecific_Types**.
