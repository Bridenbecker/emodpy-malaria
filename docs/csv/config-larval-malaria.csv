"Habitats","array of json objects","NA","NA","NA","A measure of the habitat type and scale factors used to estimate larval population. This parameter is an array of JSON objects where each object specifies scale factor for a given habitat type or, for LINEAR_SPLINE, with a more detailed configuration for scaling.  The numeric scaling value represents larval density with the number of larvae in a 1x1-degree area. The factor multiplicatively scales the resulting weather or population-dependent functional form. See :doc:`vector-model-larval-habitat` for more information.
Possible habitat values are: 

CONSTANT
    Larval carrying capacity is constant throughout the year and does not depend on weather. However, mosquito abundance will exhibit a seasonal signal due to the effects of temperature on aquatic developmental rates.
TEMPORARY_RAINFALL
    This habitat type corresponds to temporary puddles which are replenished by rainfall and drained through evaporation and infiltration. Habitat availability is proportional to temperature and humidity, and decays over time as configured by the parameter **Temporary_Habitat_Decay_Factor**.
WATER_VEGATATION
    This habitat type corresponds to semi-permanent habitats, such as developing vegetation on the edges of small water sources such as swamps or rice cultivation settings. Development of habitat lags behind rainfall, and typically peaks near the end of the rainy season. Habitat decays daily, as specified by the parameter **Semipermanent_Habitat_Decay_Rate**.
HUMAN_POPULATION
    This habitat type scales with correlates of human development, such as available water in pots in urban areas. It is configured by multiplying the number of people in a node's population times the capacity value set for this parameter, and is not climate-dependent.
BRACKISH_SWAMP
    This habitat type deals with the dynamics of how rain fills brackish swamps, how this habitat availability decays, and includes a rainfall-driven mortality threshold. Habitat decay rate is specified by the parameter **Semipermanent_Habitat_Decay_Rate**.
LINEAR_SPLINE
    The LINEAR_SPLINE configuration specifies the day of year, larval value, and larval capacity scaling number. The model linearly interpolates the values to estimate the habitat availability for each vector species without requiring climatological data.
ALL_HABITATS
    Scale equally across all habitat types.

The values set here can be scaled per node using **LarvalHabitatMultiplier** in the demographics file (see :ref:`demo-nodeattributes`) or per intervention using **Larval_Habitat_Multiplier** in the campaign file (see :doc:`parameter-campaign-node-scalelarvalhabitat`).
