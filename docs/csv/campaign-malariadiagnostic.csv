"Diagnostic_Type","enum","NA","NA","BLOOD_SMEAR_PARASITES","The type of malaria diagnostic used. Possible values are:

BLOOD_SMEAR_PARASITES
     A sample of blood is viewed under a microscope and the number of parasites per microliter of blood is counted. This diagnostic includes some randomness because real-world smear tests may not perfectly measure parasite levels in a person's system. **Detection_Threshold** is the number of parasites per microliter of blood. This setting uses the **Measurement_Sensitivity** parameter and if **measurement** is larger than **Detection_Threshold** in the following equation, a positive diagnosis is made:

        ``measurement = ( 1 / Measurement_Sensitivity ) * Poisson (x)`` where ``x = Measurement_Sensitivity * true_parasite_density``
BLOOD_SMEAR_GAMETOCYTES
     A sample of blood is viewed under a microscope and the number of gametocytes per microliter of blood is counted. This diagnostic includes some randomness because real-world smear tests may not perfectly measure gametocyte levels in a person's system. **Detection_Threshold** is the number of gametocytes per microliter of blood. This setting uses the **Measurement_Sensitivity** parameter and if **measurement** is larger than **Detection_Threshold** in the following equation, a positive diagnosis is made:

        ``measurement = ( 1 / Measurement_Sensitivity ) * Poisson (x)`` where ``x = Measurement_Sensitivity * true_gametocyte_density``
FEVER
    The fever detection threshold is defined as the number of degrees Celsius above a normal body temperature of 37 degrees. If a person's body temperature is above this threshold, a positive diagnosis is made. For example, a **Detection_Threshold** of 2 would result in a positive diagnosis for temperatures above 39 degrees. Fever as a diagnostic uses a model of cytokines based on the paper `Innate immunity to malaria <https://doi.org/10.1038/nri1311>`_.
PCR_PARASITES
    The intervention models a quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) type measurement of parasite density and draws a value from a random Gaussian distribution. **Detection_Threshold** is the number of parasites per microliter of blood. This measurement is based on the paper `Improving statistical inference on pathogen densities estimated by quantitative molecular methods: malaria gametocytaemia as a case study <http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-014-0402-2>`_.
PCR_GAMETOCYTES
    The intervention models a quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA) type measurement of gametocyte density and draws a value from a random Gaussian distribution. **Detection_Threshold** is the number of gametocytes per microliter of blood. This measurement is based on the paper `Improving statistical inference on pathogen densities estimated by quantitative molecular methods: malaria gametocytaemia as a case study <http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-014-0402-2>`_.
PF_HRP2
    Measures the number of picograms of histidine-rick protein 2 (HRP2) in a microliter of blood. **Detection_Threshold** is in picograms of HRP2 per microliter of blood. This is modeled with boost and decay parameters and is based on the paper `Modelling the dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 in human malaria to better understand malaria rapid diagnostic test performance <https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-11-74>`_.
