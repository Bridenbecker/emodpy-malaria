Possible values are:

BARCODE_STRING
    This option allows the user to specify a genome via the barcode.  The barcode provided will set the values of the barcode locations and the rest of the locations will depend on the **Parasite_Genetics** configuration parameter **Var_Gene_Randomness_Type** setting.  If the setting is FIXED_MSP or FIXED_NEIGHBORHOOD, then the barcode will be used to set where in the variant range the MSP and PfEMP1 values will come from.  It is assumed that if a person has had an infection with a particular barcode, then it is likely that they have antibodies to fight a new infection with the same barcode.  It is necessary to have multiple distributions of this intervention with different barcode strings in order to get infection diversity.
ALLELE_FREQUENCIES
    This option allows the user to specify that each new infection from this outbreak will have a its genome created using the frequencies defined in the **Barcode_Allele_Frequencies_Per_Genome_Location** parameters.  This is like selecting a delay time from a distribution and allows random creation of new genomes.  However, after the outbreak, new genomes are only created via meiosis and recombination.
NUCLEOTIDE_SEQUENCE
    This option allows the user to specify the entire nucleotide sequence including the MSP and major epitope values.
